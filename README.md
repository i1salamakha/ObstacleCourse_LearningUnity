# ObstacleCourse_LearningUnity

# This is a learning experiment with most if not all of the code and associated files in here.
# When the game or learning experiment I will do my best to put it in this repository so that anyone should be able to look at it and or edit it for their own.

# This obstacle course is a lesson off of a Udemy course titled "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D" taught by Ben Tristem.

# This will be, as mentioned before, an obstacle course with the purpose of learning player boundries, movement, momentum and general physics that can be applied to a basic game.
# The player is just a capsule whom I have named Steve so that I have an emotional response anytime I suck at making the code or suck at my own game when its finished.
# There will the boundry walls to navigate around like a puzzle and misc. objects laying about that can me moved anytime Steve touches them.
# There should be objects that roll down hills and things that pretty much move whenever.

# Post Lesson Goals

# Rotating objects that knock around Steve
# Scoreboard
# Entrance and Exit that might be able to light up or give indication when Steve has reached them
# Moving enemies

# Additional features might be added for the fun of it and learning experience!
